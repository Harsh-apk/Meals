A simple open source app that suggests you random meals with instructions and video recipe to cook by yourself.


Made with ❤️ in Native Android using:
Kotlin, 
Jetpack Compose, 
Jetpack Navigation, 
Material3 icons, 
Coil for image loading, 
Retrofit and 
themealdb.com free api.

Would love to see some contributions to this project :)
