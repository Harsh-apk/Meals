# Meals

## A simple open source app that suggests you random meals with instructions and video recipe to cook by yourself.

Made with ❤️ in Native Android using:
* Kotlin,
* Jetpack Compose,
* Jetpack Navigation,
* Material3 icons,
* Coil for image loading,
* Retrofit and
* [Free meal API](https://www.themealdb.com/) free api.

* Would love to see some contributions to this project :)
